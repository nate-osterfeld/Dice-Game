In this 2 player game of chance, each roll of the dice could mean win or lose. The rules are as follows. Each roll will contribute to that player's "round score". You can roll for as long as you'd like, but don't get too selfish! If a player rolls a "1" then the round is over and it will become the other player's turn. If a "6" is rolled twice or more (does not matter who rolled first), then whoever rolls it will lose ALL their points. HINT: Use this to attack your opponent. The final rule is once your score is over 80, rolling a "1" will reduce your points back down to 50! First player to collect 100 (can set score lower or higher) points will be declared the winner! Notes: Netlify won't show the icons that should be marking the buttons, so if you want to see the full version, there's a little more in store when run on your local machine.
